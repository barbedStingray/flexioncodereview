### Flexion Code Challenge
Hello! This is my submission for the Flexion Code Challenge in April of 2024. 


## The Goal
The objective of this application is to assist teachers in grading their students unit conversion worksheets. They are to provide ..............

## Unit Libraries
The current Temperature and Volume library function as references for the UnitConverter.jsx component. Essentially, they are the database for the project. Each library contains four keys (title, units, conversions, minimums) that are used in various functions for converting units or applying parameters.

    - title: Identifies the name of the metric that is being converted.
    - units: Identifies all units included in the (title) metric.
    - conversions: Contain the conversion values or equations to transform different units.
    - minimums: Indicate a minimum parameter of a given unit. (ex: Kelvin - Absolute Zero)


## Testing

    - Validating Inputs
