# Flexion Code Challenge (unit-conversion)
Hello! This is my submission for the Flexion Code Challenge in April of 2024. 


## Project Description
The objective of this application is to assist teachers in grading worksheets for their science unit. Teachers can input their questions, unit parameters, and answers to validate a students response. 

    Current Unit Conversions
        - Temperatures: Kelvin, Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Rankine
        - Volumes: Liters, Tablespoons, Cubic-inches, Cups, Cubic-feet, and Gallons


## Deployment
The app is currently deployed through Vercel. 
[View App Here](https://flexioncodereview.vercel.app).

## Running the App
If you would like to run the app locally, feel free to clone it down to your device. 
    
    On the Command Line... 
        - npm install
        - npm start

## Development Tasks
    1. 
    2. Function Constructor - Security Concerns
    3. Integrate Testing in Deployments
    4.
    5. Refine the UX/UI based on client needs







<!-- ## Unit Libraries
The current Temperature and Volume library function as references for the UnitConverter.jsx component. Essentially, they are the database for the project. Each library contains four keys that are used in functions and components for converting units or applying parameters, or displaying to the Dom.

    Library Keys
    - title: Identifies the name of the metric that is being converted.
    - units: Identifies all units included in the (title) metric.
    - conversions: Contain the conversion values or equations to transform different units.
    - minimums: Indicate a minimum parameter of a given unit. (ex: Kelvin - Absolute Zero)
